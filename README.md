# Reusable Workflows

This is a placeholder repo for multiple GitHub Actions I use in my personal and open source projects.

Check the permissions in each reusable workflow to ensure the GITHUB_TOKEN you pass from your calling workflow meets the required permissions.

[Workflows](.github/workflows)

Please reuse the following files in this repository in your own as they are used by the reusable workflows:

- [labeler.yaml](.github/labeler.yml)
- [release-drafter.yaml](.github/release-drafter.yml)
