# Reusable Workflows

This is a placeholder repo for multiple GitHub Actions I use in my personal and open source projects.

> [!CAUTION]
> Check the permissions in each reusable workflow to ensure the GITHUB_TOKEN you pass from your calling workflow meets the required permissions.
>
> [Workflows](.github/workflows)

> [!TIP]
> You can reuse the following files in this repository in your own as they are used by the reusable workflows:
>
> - [labeler.yml](.github/labeler.yml)
> - [release-drafter.yaml](.github/release-drafter.yml)

> [!WARNING]  
> The container image generated in this repo is a placeholder.  It uses [alpine:latest and says "Hello World"](https://github.com/jmeridth/reusable-workflows/blob/main/Dockerfile)
